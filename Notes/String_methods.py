# ZC 1st String Method Notes

#string = input("write something:  ")
#a string method is something that changes the string
#print ((string.upper()) + "!")
#but it is not really changed
#print (string)
#but users are idiots, so you have to idiot proof your code
#string2 = input("write another thing")
#print (string2)
#string2 = string2.strip()
#print (string2)
#string2 = string2.lower()
#print (string2)
#F_STRINGS!!!!!!!
#print (f"I do not know what {string2} or {string} mean!")
#indexing!
Words = "how much wood would a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?"
word = input("tell me a word")
num = (Words.index(word))
